## Operational Framework: How Fantasy Platforms Work  

### Core Mechanics  
- **Team Drafting**: Users create virtual teams by selecting real athletes from upcoming matches. Points are awarded based on real-world performance metrics (e.g., runs scored, wickets taken)[1][2].  
- **Contest Types**:  
  - **Free-to-Play**: Attracts casual users with non-monetary rewards.  
  - **Paid Entry**: Users pay fees (e.g., ₹25–₹1,000 on Dream11) to compete for cash prizes[2][6].  
- **Scoring Algorithms**: Performance stats are converted into fantasy points using proprietary formulas, often incorporating advanced analytics[1].  

### Revenue Streams  
| **Model**          | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                     |  
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|

| Sponsorships        | Brand partnerships (e.g., My11Circle’s IPL 2024 deal)                           | Pepsi sponsors leaderboards     |  
| Premium Subscriptions| Ad-free experiences, advanced stats ($9.99/month on ESPN)                       | ESPN Fantasy Premium            |

## Web3 Disruption: NFTs and Decentralization  

### Innovations vs. Traditional Models  
| **Feature**         | **Traditional Platforms**                      | **Web3 Platforms**                          |  
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| Asset Ownership      | Teams reset annually; no ownership            | NFTs enable permanent, tradable player cards|  
| Rewards              | Cash prizes                                   | Cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH) and governance tokens |  
| Community Governance | Centralized decision-making                   | DAO-based voting on rule changes            |
